# PacMan

PacMan game created in C++ with SFML library for C++ course at university.
Main point of making the project was to understand the logic behind object-oriented programming.
I decided to go with SFML, to learn basics of game development without going into deep details of graphics.
Typical pattern with such games is to make a Game-state-manager. And so did I.
